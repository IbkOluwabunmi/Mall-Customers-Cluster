# KMeans Clustering and Analysis for Mall Customers
Customer segmentation using KMeans clustering

This project applies KMeans clustering to segment mall customers into five distinct groups based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The goal is to uncover meaningful customer profiles that can guide marketing, product targeting, and business decision-making.

Tools used:  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Dataset: [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)

Project Summary: 
Using the Elbow Method, I identified five clusters as the optimal number to represent meaningful customer segments. The analysis highlights customer behavior patterns and spending tendencies, which can be used to improve marketing and business strategy.

Key Business Insights
Cluster 1: Young, Low-Income, High-Spenders
Age: Around 25
Income: Low (~$26k)
Spending Score: High (~75)

Insight: These customers tend to spend heavily despite lower income. They are likely to respond well to trend-based marketing or loyalty programs.


Cluster 2: Young Professionals with High Income and High Spending
Age: Around mid-30s
Income: High (~$86k)
Spending Score: Very High (~82)

Insight: This is the most profitable group. They are ideal for premium product offerings and exclusive deals.


Cluster 3: Older, Moderate Income, Low Spenders
Age: Around 55
Income: Moderate (~$48k)
Spending Score: Low (~42)

Insight: This segment may prefer conservative spending. Offers focused on savings or bundled products could appeal to them.


Cluster 4: Middle-Income, Low-Spending Group
Age: Late 20s
Income: Average (~$54k)
Spending Score: Low (~41)

Insight: Although income is average, they spend conservatively. Discounts or promotions might help increase engagement.


Cluster 5: High-Income, Very Low-Spending Customers
Age: Older adults
Income: High (~$90k)
Spending Score: Very Low (~18)

Insight: Despite high earnings, this group spends very little. Their preferences may not align with current mall offerings. Further research or feedback collection is recommended.


Recommendations
Create marketing campaigns tailored to each customer segment.
Focus on retaining high-value customers (Clusters 1 and 2).
Engage low-spending but high-income segments (Cluster 5) through customer feedback and premium offers.
Use these clusters to guide product placement, advertising, and customer service decisions.

This analysis supports personalized marketing and business planning for mall operations.
